Hi there! I’m Atharv Jain — currently exploring the world of Python and Data Science 🐍📊.

I started by building a few websites for clients as a freelancer, which gave me a solid start with code and real-world problem solving. But now, I’m focused on working with data — finding patterns, asking questions, and figuring out cool things with Python and turn it into something useful using tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
